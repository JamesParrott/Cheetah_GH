# Cheetah
Cheetah runs Grasshopper components, and runs Grasshopper from the command line.  Output from Python components in Grasshopper can be sent to the command line.  Cheetah can stop Grasshopper from a Python component, and return any exit code (this is not reliable if changes were made to tnhe .gh document).

The CLI Rhino runner requires Python 3.
